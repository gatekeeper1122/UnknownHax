# UnknownHax 
UnknownHax is a script for 2Take1 that combines Unknown's Stat Editor, MissionFucker, DecalChanger and GlobalHax together in a neat package.

## What does each script do?
- **Unknown's Stat Editor**: Allows you unlock to items (Rims, Tattoo's, Clothing etc..) through statistics.
- **MissionFucker**: Allows you to skip through heist preperations and other missions.
- **DecalChanger**: Allows you to add Decals to your Character that the 2Take1 Outfit Editor seems to lack.
- **GlobalHax**: Allows for RP / Money methods as shown in the script.

### ⚠ Warning ⚠
**[Unknown's_Unlocker]**
<br>
Unlocking too much stuff at once **MAY** result in your character getting corrupted!

**[MissionFucker]**
<br>
Attention: There is a cooldown that affects all Heists, this cooldown of 15 minutes is for high value payments, so if you want to repeat the heist with your friends, I recommend that after the end of each Heist, you wait about 15 minutes (in real life) for the next payment to be made on your account (or on your friends').


**[GlobalHax]**
<br>
In some scenarios the multiplier can be set too high, to fix this open the .LUA file in any text editor
and change the value smaller (CTRL+F and type Multiplier) then edit what I have it currently set to by default.

## FaQ
- **How does this script affect my game?** It changes statistics, globals and outfits based on GTA Online's own functions.
- **Can I be banned for changing some stats?** No, you can't unless you edit some stats on your own. Everything implemented is deemed as safe.
