# Unknown's Unlocker
A fork of jhowkNx's "Heist Control v2" with my own additions added.

### ⚠ Warning ⚠
Unlocking too much stuff at once **MAY** result in your character getting corrupted!

Attention: There is a cooldown that affects all Heists, this cooldown of 15 minutes is for high value payments that the Heist Control can offer, so if you want to restart (repeat) the heist with your friends, I recommend that after the end of each Heist, you wait about 15 minutes (in real life) for the next payment to be made on your account (or on your friends').

## FaQ
* How does this script affect my game?
It only changes some stats, its entire function is based on GTA Online's own stats.
* Can I be banned for changing some stats?
Yes, you can.

This project is free. I do not recommend paying for this script if you found it on some random forum on the internet.
